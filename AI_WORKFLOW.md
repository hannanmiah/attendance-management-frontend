The goal is to create a simple Single Page Application (SPA) with the following features:

  * Display students.
  * Implement search/filter functionality by class.
  * Incorporate pagination (must use Laravel pagination).

  * Allow the user to select a class/section, which will then load the corresponding students.
  * Provide functionality to mark attendance (Present/Absent/Late).
  * Include a bulk action option for attendance marking.
  * Display the real-time attendance percentage.

**3. Dashboard**

  * Display today’s attendance summary.
  * Show a monthly attendance chart (using Chart.js or a similar library).
